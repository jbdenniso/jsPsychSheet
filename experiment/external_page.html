<p class="western">Your participation in this research study will
last for one session, the duration of which will be anywhere between

your consent to participate, we will collect basic demographics from
you and have you fill out some questionnaires about your typical
behavior. This may include (but is not limited to) preferences about
specific items or actions, thoughts about your own actions, and
familiarity with specific items.  Remember that all the decisions and
choices that you make during this study are your own opinions and
preferences. There are no right or wrong answers. Please answer
honestly and to the best of your abilities.</font></font></p>

may experience mild discomfort from being asked about personal
thoughts and experiences on our questionnaires. However, in our

distress has occurred. If necessary, your study can be interrupted or
terminated. You are free to terminate participation at any point
during the study.</font></font></p>

<p class="western">To the extent allowed by law, we limit the viewing
of your personal information to people who have to review it. We
cannot promise complete secrecy. The IRB, Temple University, Temple
University Health System, Inc. and its affiliates, the Scientific
Research Network on Decision Neuroscience, the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), the Office of Human Research Protections, and Aging,
and other representatives of these organizations may inspect and copy
your information.</p>

on your responses, you may be invited to participate in subsequent
studies for additional research credit or monetary compensation.
Participation in additional studies is completely voluntary and does
not affect the credit you will receive for completing this current
online survey.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff">
<font face="Times, sans-serif"><font face="Times New Roman, sans-serif">As
you know, occasionally individuals have significant emotional
problems where they become a danger to themselves or others during
the young adult years. If this is your situation, we may need to
refer you for help. In this case, we would need to communicate some
of the information you have provided to us in the interview to the
clinician to whom we have referred you. For example, we might need to
communicate to the clinician whether the emotional problems were
seriously interfering with your life (e.g., your school work, your
eating).&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff">
<font face="Times, sans-serif">Although we are not asking about
maltreatment, if we learned that a child, elderly person, or disabled
person was being physically or sexually harmed, we are legally
required to report this.</font></p>
<p class="western"><u><b>Data Sharing.</b></u> The data and samples
from this study might be used for other, future research projects in
addition to the study you are currently participating in. Those
future projects can focus on any topic that might be unrelated to the
goals of this study. We will give access to the data we are
collecting to the general public via the Internet and a fully open
database.</p>
<p class="western">The data we share with the general public will not
have your name on it, only a code number, so people will not know
your name or which data are yours. In addition, we will not share any
other information that we think might help people who know you guess
which data are yours.</p>
<p class="western">If you change your mind and withdraw your consent
to participate in this study (you can call Dr. Smith at 215-204-1552
to do this), we will not collect any additional data about you. We
will delete your data if you withdraw before it was deposited in the
database.&nbsp;<b>However, any data and research results already
shared with other investigators or the general public cannot be
destroyed, withdrawn or recalled.</b></p>
<p class="western">By agreeing to participate, you will be making a
free and generous gift for research that might help others. It is
possible that some of the research conducted using your information
eventually could lead to the development of new methods for studying
brain, new diagnostic tests, new drugs or other commercial products.
Should this occur, there is no plan to provide you with any part of
the profits generated from such products and you will not have any
ownership rights in the products.</p>
<p class="western">To the best of our knowledge, the data we release
to the general public will not contain information that can directly
identify you. The data will not have your name on it, only a code
number, so people will not know your name or which data are yours. In
addition, the data will not include data that we think might help
people who know you guess which data are yours, such as your facial
features or the date that you participated. If we write a report or
article about this study or share the study data set with others, we
will do so in such a way that you cannot be directly identified.
However, by using additional data linked to your name, one could
potentially associate your information in our database back to you.
In addition a security breach (break in or cyber attack) might lead
to someone being able to link you to your data. This risk is very low
because your data are stored in a secure database, and the
information about your identity is stored separately from the data
themselves, linked only through a code.</p>
<p class="western">We will keep the private portion (name, contact
information etc.) of your data in a secure location for at least 3
years. This way if one of the researchers that obtained the data from
us will find something in your brain scans that would have a
diagnostic value we will be able to contact you. After this period of
time we will destroy this information to protect your privacy.</p>
<p class="western"><b>Letting us use and share your data is
voluntary. However, you must be willing to share your data in this
way in order to participate in this study. If you are not willing,
you cannot participate in this study.</b></p>
<p class="western">By signing below, you agree to provide your data
for future research. You agree that these may be shared with other
investigators at other institutions from around the world. The
details, results, and implications of these studies are unknown.</p>
